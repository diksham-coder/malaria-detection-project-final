# 🦟 Malaria Detection Project


A deep learning-powered web application that detects malaria from blood cell images using a fine-tuned **MobileNetV2** model. Upload a blood smear image and get an instant prediction — **Parasitized** or **Uninfected**.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Model Training** — A MobileNetV2 model is fine-tuned on the [NIH Malaria Cell Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria), which contains over 27,000 cell images split equally between parasitized and uninfected classes.
2. **Backend** — A Flask server loads the trained `.h5` model and exposes a REST API endpoint for image inference.
3. **Frontend** — A clean HTML/JS interface allows users to upload blood smear images and view predictions in real time.
